// what is the correct way to push code in github ? 
// => the correct way to push code in github is to push code without a node_module folder.
//      and we can also create a file named as '.gitignore'
//          inside .gitignore = /node_module
// basically write here what files should not be pushed in github

// how to recover a node_modules if they are deleted?
// => we need a package.json file to know what are the required modules for the projects and if we simply run the 'npm install' command in terminal 
    // the the npm automatically downloads the required modules.
