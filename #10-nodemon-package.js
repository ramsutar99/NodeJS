// nodemon is a module, this module is used to save time
// why we need nodemon?
// => when we update a js file we need to run this file again in terminal to show the output.
//  but with the use of nodemon module js file automatically runs after any updation in file.
//  this is how the nodemon can save our time from rerunning the file
